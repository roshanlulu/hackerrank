## Hacker Rank C++ tutorials

- How to compile
`g++ filename.cpp -o filename.out && ./filename.out`

#### Input and Output
- In this challenge, we're practicing reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout.

#### Basic Data Types
- Accept each data type as an input and output it in the received order.

#### Conditional Statements
For each integer n, if 1 < n < 9; display english representation of the digit, else display Greater than 9.

#### For loop
- For each integer n, if 1 < n < 9; display english representation of the digit, else display even or odd.

#### Functions
- You have to write a program which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

#### Pointers
- Use pointers to read two integers and return their sum and the absolute difference. 

#### Arrays
- You'll be an given array of  integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.

#### Variable sized Arrays
- Get familiarized with the usage of variable sized arrays.

#### Virtual Functions
- This problem is to get you familiar with virtual functions. Create three classes Person, Professor and Student. The class Person should have data members name and age. The classes Professor and Student should inherit from the class Person.

#### Boxit
- Design a class named Box whose dimensions are integers and private to the class. The dimensions are labelled: length , breadth , and height . Get familiarized with function and operator overloading(using this operator and friend function).
