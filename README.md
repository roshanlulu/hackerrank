- How to compile
`g++ filename.cpp -o filename.out && ./filename.out`

#### Input and Output
- In this challenge, we're practicing reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout.

#### Basic Data Types
- Accept each data type as an input and output it in the received order.

#### Conditional Statements
For each integer n, if 1 < n < 9; display english representation of the digit, else display Greater than 9.

#### For loop
- For each integer n, if 1 < n < 9; display english representation of the digit, else display even or odd.

#### Functions
- You have to write a program which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

#### Pointers
- Use pointers to read two integers and return their sum and the absolute difference.
